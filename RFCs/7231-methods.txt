------------OVERVIEW------------
--------------------------------

The request method indicates the reason of the to make a this request and what he expects
as a successful result. The request methods can be further specialized by some header fields
in a request. These methods can also have conflicts with header fields.
method = token
There are standardized methods commonly used in HTTP (uppercase, US-ASCII) :
	-GET : Transfer a current representation of the target resource.
	-HEAD : Same as GET, but only transfer the status line and header section.
	-POST : Perform resource-specific processing on the request payload.
	-PUT : Replace all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
	-DELETE : Remove all current representations of the target resource.
	-CONNECT : Establish a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
 	-OPTIONS : Describe the communication options for the  target resource.
	-TRACE : Perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
All general-purpose servers must support the methods GET and HEAD. All other methods are optional.
The set of methods allowed by a target resource can be listed in an Allow header field.

Request methods are considered "safe" if their defined semantics are essentially read-only.
GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE are defined to be safe.
