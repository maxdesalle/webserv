# RFC3686 - Uniform Ressource Identifier

## URI

```
`URI` ::=  `scheme` ":" `hier-part` [ "?" `query` ] [ "#" `fragment` ]
```

## Hier-part

```
`hier-part` ::= "//" `authority` `path-abempty`
             |   `path-absolute`
             |   `path-rootless`
             |   `path-empty`
```

When authority is present, the path must either be empty or begin with a slash ("/") character. When authority is not present, the path cannot begin with two slash characters ("//").

## Authority

```
`authority `= [ `userinfo` "@" ] `host` [ ":" `port` ]
```

The authority component is preceded by a double slash ("//") and is terminated by the next slash ("/"), question mark ("?"), or number sign ("#") character, or by the end of the URI.

The "http" scheme considers a missing authority or empty host invalid.


## Host

```
`host` ::= "[" `IPv6address` "]"
        |  `IPv4address`
        |  reg-name
```

## Path

```
path ::= `path-abempty`  ; begins with "/" or is empty
      |  `path-absolute` ; begins with "/" but not "//"
      |  `path-noscheme` ; begins with a non-colon segment
      |  `path-rootless` ; begins with a segment
      |  `path-empty`    ; zero characters
```
A path consists of a sequence of path `segments` separated by a slash
("/") character.

## Fragment

The fragment identifier is not used in the scheme-specific processing of a URI; instead, the fragment identifier is separated from the rest of the URI prior to a dereference, and thus the identifying information within the fragment itself is dereferenced solely by the user agent, regardless of the URI scheme.

## Example
```http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt```

- `scheme` : http
- `host` : www.ietf.org
- `path` : /rfc/rfc2396.txt

## URI-reference

```
`URI-reference` ::= `URI`
                 |  `relative-ref`
```
## Relative Reference or target-URI

```
`relative-ref` ::= `relative-part` [ "?" `query` ] [ "#" `fragment` ]
```
```
`relative-part` ::= "//" `authority` `path-abempty`
                 |  `path-absolute`
                 |  `path-noscheme`
                 |  `path-empty`
```

## Absolute URI

```
`absolute-URI` ::= `scheme` ":" `hier-part` [ "?" `query` ]
```

# Percent-Encoding

Non-ASCII characters or reserved characters must first be encoded according to UTF-8, and then each octet of the corresponding UTF-8 sequence must be percentencoded to be represented as URI characters.
### Example
- `%x20` : SP
- `%C3%80` : 'à' (not `%E0` !)

# Merge Paths

- If the base URI has a defined authority component and an empty path, then return a string consisting of "/" concatenated with the reference’s path
- Return a string consisting of the reference’s path component appended to **all but the last segment of the base URI’s path** (i.e., excluding any characters after the right-most "/" in the base URI path, **or excluding the entire base URI path if it does not contain any "/" characters).**
